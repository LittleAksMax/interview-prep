# Introduction

## The Interview Process

Data structures and algorithms questions are valuable to the interviewer for testing fundamental problem
solving skills with questions that are often incredibly difficult to avoid clustering candidates in terms
of performance.

You are evaluated **relative** to other candidates, so you are most likely to find questions with many steps
that don't necessarily require special knowledge about any concepts (at least for general software
engineering) - this forces the candidates to have to utilise problem solving skills instead of just
memorisation.

A company's response might be delayed. No response != rejection (just inquire).

You can reapply after 6 months - 1 year after initial application. You may be disadvantaged past your first
two applications.

## Behind the Scenes

The most common interview process involves:
- Screening phone interview (still relatively technical)
- 3 to 6 in-person interviews

Some interviewers give homework assignments for you to do after the phone interview.

"Why do you want to work for xyz" is a common question.
- Express passion for their technology
- Get familiar with the companies products

### Microsoft

You meet the hiring manager if you've done really well.

### Amazon

Prefer questions about scalability and object-oriented/system design. This will unfortunately not be the
focus of this repository.

The 'bar raiser' is moved in from another team. They have veto power in decision and are used to make one of
the interviewers really difficult.

### Google

Prefer system design and scalability. Strong focus on analytical algorithmic questions. If you have little
work experience, you will be bullied by the data structures and algorithms questions especially.

Google has a hiring committee who rely on interviewers notes to make the decision.

### Apple

2-on-1 interviews.

They especially have employees that are passionate Apple fans. You should be familiar with a Mac system.

Usually 6-8 interviews on campus. Each interviewer will focus on a different aspects.

### Facebook

They want developers who work quickly and elegantly.

Facebook interviews for the whole company, not just a single team. After you get hired you get caught up to
speed on their projects and codebases in a 6-week bootcamp.

### Palantir

- 2 phone interviews
- HackerRank coding assignment (likely for those with less work experience)

You may be shown a demo of a Palantir product and then you are encouraged to ask questions about the product.
Ask good questions.

On average, their technical questions are up to a much higher standard.

Lots of emphasis on the efficiency of the algorithms you produce.

## Special Situations

I will only make notes on Experienced Candidates, Dev Lead/Manager, Startups and Acquisitions/Acquihires since
that's what is important for me.

### Experienced candidates

Likely to have a smaller focus on technical coding questions and a bit more on system design. This is because
they'd have worked with more large systems (compared to students for example) and would be out of practice
with the algorithms you learn at university.

Also likely to get asked questions about impressive projects you've worked on before:
- "What is the hardest bug you've faced"

### Dev Lead/Manager

Still tested for strong coding skills. Also tested on Teamwork, Prioritisation, Communication, and being able
to just 'get things done'. Depends a lot on experience and personality.

### Startups

Most often you can get opportunities through personal referral. You can even just reach out and showing
interest to someone in the company could get your resume picked up.

You should be familiar with their technologies since they want you to be able to be stuck right into the deep
end.

Regular interviewing process except stronger focus on personality/experience (Behavioural questions) and having a skill
set that is already compatible with the company.

### Acquisitions/Acquihires

These interviews can ruin the acquisition if they don't go well enough on average. It can be a screening for
the company and so change the value of the company.

Engineers at the startup that don't perform well in the interviews don't get hired to the buyer company --
sometimes they get given a short contract the buyer company for 'knowledge transfer'. CEO's are often slotted
into a product manager/lead position, since that mirrors their responsibility closest.

Often the engineers that are kept are either merged with another team in the buyer's company.

## Before the Interview

### Getting the right experience

Get internships during university.

Take modules that have large courseworks as part of them.

Use your nights and weekends for building projects, participating in Hackathons, contribute to open source.
Employers like candidates that build stuff 'just for fun' -- it shows initiative and passion for the field.

### Writing a great CV

1 page for <10 years experience, 2 pages past that.

Relevant hobbies/activities take precendence over non-relevant hobbies/activities.

Strong bullet points should highlight measurable achievements: include specific metrics:
- 'Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z'
- Reduced object-time rendering by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in
  login time.
- Increased average match accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm based on
  windiff.

Only include relevant work experience/projects/technologies FOR EACH APPLICATION. Projects that highlight
skills that are required for a certain role should be included over others in the limited space you have for
the CV. Try to list things like programming languages concisely:
- Java (expert), Python (fluent), C/C++ (proficient)

Don't use time as a measure of language proficiency, because it's unclear exactly how much of that time you
were actually using and actively programming in the language.

Include 2-4 'impressive' projects. The best projects solve a certain problem -- they are useful.

#### Stigmas

Some technologies/languages have stigmas against them. Apparently everything .NET is only good for jobs
where .NET is a required technology.

Don't overdo the languages you know, maybe 6 relevant ones only. But make sure it's more than 2.

Only include certifications that are impressive and relevant concepts (e.g., usage of technologies, e.g., AWS
\> certification in some programming language).

## Behavioural Questions

### Projects

For each project you mentioned in your application, you can list the:
- Challenges
- Mistakes/Failures
- What you enjoyed
- Leadership examples
- Conflicts
- What you'd do differently

This prepares you for any in-depth conversations about your projects and will make your answers seem more
fluent.

### What are your weaknesses?

**Don't be arrogant**. Say a legitimate weakness, how you've improved on it/overcome it.
- Sometimes I don't have very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly,
  it also means that sometimes I make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone
  else double-check my work.
- I often want my code to be perfect before it actually works. This means that I often end up in a perpetual
  refactor loop, where I keep changing the same small piece of code over and over again and it often ends up
  over-engineered. Because of that, I usually make a list of features and then a To-Do list with the series of
  tasks to get to my goal. This let's me build up to perfect code in a steady fashion.

### Questions to ask the interviewer

They come in three categories:
- Genuine - questions for valuable information that shows your interest
  - What is the ratio of developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project
    planning happen on the team?
  - What brought you (the interviewer) to this company? What has been most challenging for you?
- Insightful - questions about the company's technology that demonstrate knowledge/understanding
  - I noticed you use technology X? How do you handle problem Y?
- Passion - questions that show your passion for the field
  - I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more. What opportunities are there at this
    company to learn more about this.
  - I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like an interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit
    more about how this works.

### Responding to Behavioural Questions

- Nugget -- succinct description of scenario
- Situation -- What was the problem?
- Action -- (most important, don't be brief, flesh it out)
- Result -- How did your actions solve/better the problem?

These answers should show that you have: leadership, empathy, compassion, humility, teamwork/helpfulness.

### Tell me about yourself?

- Current role (headline only)
- University and activities in university
- Post university and onwards (briefly)
- Current role (details)
- Outside of work (learning something new, project, etc.)
- Wrap up (why are you interviewing here? Why this company?)

Try to sprinkle in successes: awards/promotions/being recruited by ex-coworker/launches).
