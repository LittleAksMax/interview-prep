# Introduction

## The Interview Process

Data structures and algorithms questions are valuable to the interviewer for testing fundamental problem
solving skills with questions that are often incredibly difficult to avoid clustering candidates in terms
of performance.

You are evaluated **relative** to other candidates, so you are most likely to find questions with many steps
that don't necessarily require special knowledge about any concepts (at least for general software
engineering) - this forces the candidates to have to utilise problem solving skills instead of just
memorisation.

A company's response might be delayed. No response != rejection (just inquire).

You can reapply after 6 months - 1 year after initial application. You may be disadvantaged past your first
two applications.

## Behind the Scenes

The most common interview process involves:
- Screening phone interview (still relatively technical)
- 3 to 6 in-person interviews

Some interviewers give homework assignments for you to do after the phone interview.

"Why do you want to work for xyz" is a common question.
- Express passion for their technology
- Get familiar with the companies products

### Microsoft

You meet the hiring manager if you've done really well.

### Amazon

Prefer questions about scalability and object-oriented/system design. This will unfortunately not be the
focus of this repository.

The 'bar raiser' is moved in from another team. They have veto power in decision and are used to make one of
the interviewers really difficult.

### Google

Prefer system design and scalability. Strong focus on analytical algorithmic questions. If you have little
work experience, you will be bullied by the data structures and algorithms questions especially.

Google has a hiring committee who rely on interviewers notes to make the decision.

### Apple

2-on-1 interviews.

They especially have employees that are passionate Apple fans. You should be familiar with a Mac system.

Usually 6-8 interviews on campus. Each interviewer will focus on a different aspects.

### Facebook

They want developers who work quickly and elegantly.

Facebook interviews for the whole company, not just a single team. After you get hired you get caught up to
speed on their projects and codebases in a 6-week bootcamp.

### Palantir

- 2 phone interviews
- HackerRank coding assignment (likely for those with less work experience)

You may be shown a demo of a Palantir product and then 

On average, their technical questions are up to a much higher standard.

Lots of emphasis on the efficiency of the algorithms you produce.
