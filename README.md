# Interview Preparation Evidence

Evidencing interview prep using Cracking the Coding Interview and LeetCode.

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)

Notes on the introduction can be found in [the introduction notes file in the CtCI folder](CtCI/INTRO.md).

The coding exercises are put separate files based on the type of questions they are:

- Arrays + Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks + Queues
- Trees + Graphs
- Bit Manipulation
- Maths + Logic Puzzles
- Recursion + Dynamic Programming
- Sorting + Searching
- Moderate
- Hard

The preamble of each file will explain the question and the category it belongs to so they can be sorted as required.

I will be skipping the OO Design/Testing/Databases/System Design/Threads and Locks/C and C++/Java sections since this I am more interested in developing my problem solving skills under pressure/time constraint.

## LeetCode

I will do a mock interview every other week of term, starting on the second week, using LeetCode's Mock Assessment feature.
I will rotate between the Online Assessment and the Phone Interview for a bit of variety.
I will not do any of the Onsite Interview assessments since they take too long, which makes it not achievable if I want to give all the questions a fair go.

The questions will be documented in the preambles of the code files after my attempts and put in their own week's folder, e.g., Week 2, Week 4, etc. The way I will do the coding will be identical to the CtCI book questions (except under time constraint).
